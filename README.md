## QUICK TUTOR

Quick Tutor is a Tutoring Service that connects Tutors to Students much like how Uber or Lyft connect Drivers to Riders.

As a student, you can request for help in a particular Subject and Course.

As a tutor, you will be shown a list of Available Jobs in the Subjects that you have indicated that you can Tutor for.

You can cancel the Session at any point in time as a Tutor or a Student.

As a Student, once you are finished with a Session, you'll be prompted to rate the Tutor and make a fixed Payment of $4.99.

You can also view your Job History as either a Tutor or a Student.

Note:

* If you have not filled in your Profile information, you'll be redirected to the Profile Page when you Request a Tutor/Start Tutoring for the first time.
* If you do not intend to Tutor in any subject, you can select 'None' from the List of Subjects
